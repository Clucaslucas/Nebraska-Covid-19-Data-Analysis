Project Overview
Nebraska-Covid-19-Data-Analysis is a small data science project focused on exploring early COVID-19 case data for Nebraska and comparing it with data from New York. The project uses a Jupyter Notebook (CovidDataVis.ipynb) to load COVID-19 case datasets, perform basic data analysis (such as calculating totals and averages of new cases), and create visualizations of the outbreak over time. This analysis provides insight into how the COVID-19 case counts grew in Nebraska during the initial phase of the pandemic (March – early April 2020) and places it in context by juxtaposing it with New York’s case trajectory, which was much steeper during the same period. The goal of the project is to demonstrate simple data analysis techniques – reading data files, cleaning/organizing the data, computing summary statistics, and plotting time-series trends – using real pandemic data. It can be useful for anyone interested in how COVID-19 impacted Nebraska in the early days and how that compares to a hotspot like New York.
Data Sources and Formats
This project includes three data files (located in the repository) and they are all small, plain-text datasets:
Nebraska_Coronavirsu_PositiveCases-1.csv – A CSV file containing daily COVID-19 case data for Nebraska. Each row represents a date and includes the number of new positive cases on that date (Positive_Cases_Per_Date) and the running total of positive cases up to that date (Total_Positive_Cases). The data begins on 3/8/2020 (when Nebraska’s first cases were recorded) with 2 new cases and a total of 2, and it continues through early April 2020. By the final date in this file, 4/6/2020, Nebraska had a cumulative total of 409 confirmed cases. (The file name has a minor typo “Coronavirsu” but contains coronavirus case data as described.)
Nebraska Positive Cases Per Date-1.txt – A simple text file listing the daily new case counts for Nebraska, one number per line. This corresponds to the “Positive_Cases_Per_Date” column from the CSV above, but without dates or other information. It’s essentially a convenience for quickly loading the daily figures. The notebook uses this file to compute summary statistics (total cases, average per day, etc.) without needing to parse a CSV. For instance, the sum of all lines in this text file is 409 (matching the total cases through 4/6/2020), and the maximum line value is 46 (the highest number of new cases on a single day).
NewYork_Nebraska_PositiveCases-1.csv – A CSV file comparing COVID-19 cases in Nebraska and New York side by side. It has five columns: Date, NEW_COVID_CASE_COUNT_Nebraska, NEW_COVID_CASE_COUNT_NewYork (daily new cases in each state), and total_NE, total_NY (cumulative totals in each state up to that date). The data starts from 3/2/2020, when New York had its first cases (Nebraska had 0 at that time), and runs through 4/6/2020. Over this period, Nebraska’s total cases grow from 0 to 409, while New York’s total cases explode from just a handful into the tens of thousands. For example, on the final date 4/6/2020, the file shows Nebraska: 46 new cases that day, 409 total cases; New York: 1200 new cases that day, 105,391 total cases. This combined dataset provides a direct comparison of the outbreak magnitude in the two states.
Data Origin: These datasets appear to be compiled from official public health data (e.g., Nebraska DHHS updates for Nebraska cases, and possibly New York state reports or a source like Johns Hopkins for New York). The notebook does not fetch data from the web; instead, the CSVs and text file are provided in the repository. All dates are in M/D/YYYY format. Note that in the combined CSV, the date for the last entry appears as “04/06/202” due to a minor formatting issue (missing the final digit), but the notebook still interprets it correctly up to 4/6/2020 when reading the CSV. No other cleaning was necessary as the files are small and well-formatted.
